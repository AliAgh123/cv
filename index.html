						I was curious about app and websites. through the years, I have
						gained some skills and experience in websites such as: HTML, CSS,
						and JS + I've participated in Science fair of 2020-2021 and won with
						my friends the golden prize. Also, I've learned C++ and started with
						python.

					<p class="robot-skill-description">
						I've started with robotics when I was around 12 years old, and
						started with LEGO and participated in Almahdi school competition
						(mc^2) and then in NERD, and I've had experience in teaching and
						being a coach in my last competition when I leaded a team of genius
						students to rank first in VRC done by Amal educational institutes.
						Also, I've learned using Arduino and some electronics to build
						robots!
